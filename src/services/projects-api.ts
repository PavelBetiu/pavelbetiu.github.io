For this matter, machine translation models will be trained on existing text simplification datasets, augmented with paraphrases, and ordered by readability scores.\n\nMoreover, the overall complexity of the text will be measured by automatically computing word Age of Acquisition (AoA) scores through incremental semantic models and regression analyses, in order to approximate the age when people adequately learn a wordâ€™s meaning.',
